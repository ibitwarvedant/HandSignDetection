HAnd Sign Language Detection (ASL Gesture Detection) using TensorFlow and OpenCV
Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time. ASL is a vital means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments, and our project seeks to enhance accessibility through technology.

Features
Real-time ASL gesture detection using a webcam or image input.
Integration with TensorFlow and OpenCV for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
Utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Seamless interpretation of ASL gestures for communication purposes.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ibitwarvedant/HandSignDetection.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd HandSignDetection

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model is not included in this repository. However, you can use your own dataset or explore publicly available ASL datasets for model training.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit feature requests, or propose improvements by creating pull requests. Please ensure adherence to the project's code of conduct.
